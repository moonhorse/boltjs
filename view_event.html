<h1>Event Handling</h1>

<p>
  All Bolt <b>View</b>s have a <b>listen</b> method which can be used to listen for both DOM and custom events.  Simply pass the event name and the function callback.  The callback can be either a function or a string, in which case it is the name of a function on the <b>View</b>s owner.  (For more information on the Owner concept, see <a href="view_building.html">Building Views</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The example below shows the case where the listen function is passed a function.  Note that the event name does not contain 'on', this is important.  The <b>event</b> parameter passed to the callback is a <a href="http://javelinjs.com">Javelin</a> event, not a standard DOM event.  This provides a number of extra functions that you can see in the <a href="http://www.phabricator.com/docs/javelin/class/JX.Event.html">Javelin Docs</a>.  To get the original DOM event, call <b>event.getRawEvent()</b>.
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
  var Button = require('views/Button').Button;
  var myButton = new Button();
  myButton.listen('mouseover', function(event) {
    console.log('mouseover event');
  });
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Using the Builder</h2>

<p>
  It is also possible to attach events when using the <a href="view_building.html">Builder</a>.  Any property set on a view passed the Builder that starts with <b>on</b> is assumed to be an event and is listened to.  The example below shows a simple version of this in use.  Note that unlike when calling the <b>listen</b> method directly, the event name begins with <b>on</b>.
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
  var Button = require('views/Button').Button;
  var myButton = builder.build({
    view: Button,
    onmouseover: function(event) {
      console.log('mouseover event');
    }
  });
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Events in the Owner</h2>

<p>
  Bolt provides a clean way of organizing event listeners when composing hierarchies of views.  Rather than pass an actual function as a listener, instead pass the string name of a function in that views <b>owner</b> (see <a href="view_building.html">Building Views</a> for an explanation of the owner concept).  This makes for a more readable view hierarchy declaration, as you don't have to pass actual functions, bind them to the view etc.
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
var Container = require('container').Container;

require('javelin/core').createClass({
  name : 'MyOwnerContainer',

  extend: Container,

  members: {
    render: function() {
      this.setLayout({
        content: "Hello World!",
        ref: "myInnerView",

        // Add two listeners, passing the names of the functions that will handle their events
        ontouchstart: "handleTouchStart",
        ontouchend: "handleTouchEnd"
      });
    },

    // Handler for the touch start event
    handleTouchStart: function(event) {
      this.refs.myInnerView.setContent("That tickles!!");
    },

    // Handler for the touch end event
    handleTouchEnd: function(event) {
      this.refs.myInnerView.setContent("Touch me again and I'll .....");
    }
  }
});

{% endhighlight %}
